### YourCabs Capstone project

The business problem tackled here is trying to improve customer service for YourCabs.com, a cab company in Bangalore. The problem of interest is booking cancellations by the company due to unavailability of a car. The challenge is that cancellations can occur very close to the trip start time,thereby causing passengers inconvenience.

#### Objective
The goal of the competition is to create a predictive model for classifying new bookings as to whether they will eventually gets cancelled due to car unavailability



#### The dataset contains details of booking records with the following columns:

| **Column Name**        | **Description**                                                                                     |

## Solution

In this project, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was conducted on the entire dataset to gain insights and identify patterns. Based on the `travel_type_id`, the dataset was categorized into three subsets, as different `travel_type_id` values correspond to unique workflows.

Since this is a classification problem, the following classification algorithms were applied to each dataset:

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **AdaBoost**  

The final prediction was made using the model that demonstrated the highest accuracy, along with good precision and recall scores, ensuring a robust and reliable solution.
